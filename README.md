# intro-self-driving-car


## PART 1

### Orientation

Welcome to the Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree program! In this section you'll get a sneak peak of the classroom, meet the team, and learn about the services provided. Then you'll take a readiness assessment and check out some learning resources to help you make the most out of your experience.

## PART 2

### Bayesian Thinking

Learn the framework that underlies a self-driving car’s understanding of itself and the world around it, and to see the world the way a self-driving car does.
Project: Joy Ride

## PART 3

### Working with Matrices

This course will focus on two tools which are vital to self-driving car engineers: object oriented programming and linear algebra.
Project: Implement a Matrix Class

## PART 4

### C++ Basics

This course is the first step in a rewarding journey towards C++ expertise. The goal is translation: get a program written in Python, and translate it into C++.
Project: Translate Python to C++

## PART 5

### Performance Programming in C++

Explore how to write good code that runs correctly. We’ll focus primarily on low level features of C++, but we’ll discuss other best practices as well.
## PART 6

### Navigating Data Structures

Algorithmic thinking is a skill you’ll refine throughout your career. In this course you’ll focus on frequently used data structures and algorithms.
Project: Implement Route Planner

## PART 7

### Visualizing Calculus and Controls

In this course you’ll learn basic calculus—the mathematics of continuity. You’ll also learn to use some of Python’s most popular visualization libraries.

## PART 8 

### Computer Vision and Machine Learning

In this course you’ll learn how a computer sees an image, and how we can use machine learning to teach a computer to identify images programmatically.
